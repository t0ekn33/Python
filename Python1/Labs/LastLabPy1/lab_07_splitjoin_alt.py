"""lab_06c_splitjoin_alt.py

This program creates two sets from the contents of two files and
eliminates the newline (\n) character from each entry.  The splitlines
string method is used to accomplish this.  Then, the join method
is used to put the newline back on each entry prior to writing the
new server file.

This version of the program nests all of the operations.  This code is
for demonstration purposes and is not recommended as a technique to
use in production programs.
