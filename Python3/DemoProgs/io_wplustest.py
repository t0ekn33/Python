"""File opened as w+

When you open a file as w+, the file is treated as new, the same
as opening with the option w.  The difference here is that when you are
finished writing the file, you can set the file to the beginning with
seek(0) and read the records. Again, if you do a write while reading,
the new records go to the end of the file.  Read operations resume
where they left off.
