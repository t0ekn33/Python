"""lab_02c_ordchr.py

This program prints the ASCII characters corresponding to the
numbers 32 through 126.  Then, from the string module, it imports
a string of all printable (including whitespace) characters. It prints
these out on separate lines along with their corresponding ordinal.
The printing uses "r" formatting which creates a printable representation
of all characters so you can see the whitespace rather than have
these control characters acted on.
