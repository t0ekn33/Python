""" lab_03d_dup_dates.py

This program generates 23 random integers in the range 1 to 365
inclusive.  Then it checks to see if any of these numbers, which
represent dates, are duplicates. It does this by using the count
method for each item in the list.  Any count that is greater than
one represents a duplicate.  Using a function here is a bit more
elegant than the previous solution.
