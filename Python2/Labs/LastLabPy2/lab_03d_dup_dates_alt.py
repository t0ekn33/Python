"""lab_03d_dup_dates_alt.py

This program generates 23 random integers in the range 1 to 365
inclusive.  Then it checks to see if any of these numbers, which
represent dates, are duplicates. It does this by using the index
method for each item in the list.
See exercise 10-8 on page 118 in **Think Python**
