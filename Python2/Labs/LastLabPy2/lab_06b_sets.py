""" lab_03d_dup_dates.py

This program generates 23 random integers in the range 1 to 365
inclusive.  Then it checks to see if any of these numbers, which
represent dates, are duplicates. It does this by adding the dates
to a set which automatically removes duplicates. If the length of the
resulting set is less than the number of people/birthdays being
tested, there were duplicate dates generated.
Also, this version of the program is more general in that you can
easily change the number of people/birthdays being tested.  Note that
there are several ways to get a well-formated line printed.
See exercise 10-8 on page 118 in **Think Python**
